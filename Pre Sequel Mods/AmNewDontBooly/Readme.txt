Adds increased shield delay to Athena's Hold The Line skill. Why? Because  I wanted Athena to keep her shield down while using aspis. Why gearbox made a melee character invulnerable to damage in a game with Roid shields I'll never know but now you can use Roid shields with her Aspis. Each point in the Hold The Line skill will add 5 seconds of recharge delay, similar to how Kreig in Borderlands 2 could also increase delay to better use Roid shields.
