Badassaurus : Same pool as UCP, added 10% chance for a Cobra.
              Note that all 3 drops can spawn at the same time.

---- Note : You should disable UCP's truckasaurus drops
            1) In BCLMM, "Loot Pool and Drop Changes" -> 2) "Specific Loot Changes" -> 3) "DLC Campaign 2" -> 3) "Add Torgue Legendaries..." ->

Better Cobra Odds : Just a fun Cobra farming feature, 
                    Every time that a Burner Ennemi drops a Sniper included in his loot pool, it will create a LootSplosion of 10 Snipers.
