Huge thanks to everyone, 
I wanted to try new changes for fun in this beautiful game that is BL2, and you guys made this possible for me ! :D

I try not to overtune my mods, 
I did include some pretty strong changes though. Just to have fun :)

If I've misspelled some words : I'm sorry I'm french (yes baguette croissant) :P

Lastly, I hope that you'll enjoy "my" mods !
Have fun everyone :D
