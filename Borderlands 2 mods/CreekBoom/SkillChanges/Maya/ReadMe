Accelerate : You have multiple choices, you can only choose one at a time.

1) Replace bullet speed by fire rate, 2% per point.
2) Replace Bullet Speed by Status Damage, 5% per point. Also rename it "Instigate".
3) Replace bullet speed by swap speed, 3% per point.
4) Remove bullet speed and gives you 5% gun damage per point instead of 3%.

---- Note : The vanilla skill isn't that bad, I just wanted to try different things.

Flicker :    Added status damage (5% per point).
