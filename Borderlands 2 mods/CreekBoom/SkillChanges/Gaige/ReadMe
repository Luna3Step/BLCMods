Interspersed Outburst : Added 5% weapon swap speed per point.

Death From Above :      Multiply it's damage by 30 and radius by 5, you can proc it every 30 seconds to compensate.

---- Note :

----I couldn't reduce the number of consumed stacks, I can change the number on the description but not the actual consumption. 
----Ideally I would like to make this skill consume 5 or 3 stacks instead of 10 and decrease it's damage and delay depending on the results in game, so you can build anarchy up even with this skill maxed out.

----Huge credit to AutumnWitch, check out her (?) Gaige rework skills it is SO much fun :)

Rational Anarchist :    Gives you 50 stacks instead of 25 to compensate the outrageous stacks consumption of Death From Above.
