Twister : 1) It's main elements comes in slag, shock, fire and corrosive, 2) You have the option to choose it's splash damage for your dual elements : fire, slag, shock, corrosive or explosive.
          3) The full explosive variant is an exception, it comes in explosive main element only.

---- Gibbed Codes : 
---- Fire : BL2(hwAAAAAFKgQACIEJB6HVrkBRg4KBMgEKGxQLKBJQ/v9noByDcoHy)
---- Corrosive : BL2(hwAAAAC7FgQACIEJB6HVrkBRg4KBMgEKG5QLKBJQ/v9noByDcoHy)
---- Slag : BL2(hwAAAAB0GwQACIEJB6HVrkBRg4KBMgEKG5QMKBJQ/v9noByDcoHy)
---- Explosive : BL2(hwAAAADHbwQACIEJB6HVrkBRg4KBMgEKG5QKKBJQ/v9noByDcoHy) 

Note : The explosive one will appear as non-elemental, 
       Switching from full explosive to another option (and vice-versa) will delete your twisters, hence the gibbed codes.
       Switching any other splash options will work fine.

---- If you want full fire or full corrosive or full slag directly, check out KuroPanther_M twister mods :)
---- I precise it because this farm takes time, and with 4 differents elements this is insanely RNG based.

Interfacer : Gave it little shotgun ammo regen while holding it.
