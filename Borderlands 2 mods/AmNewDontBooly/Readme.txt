Increases the range of Deahtrap's melee attacks so enemies can't dodge them by simply walking away. Deathtrap can't move while attacking, but he takes so long to attack that by the time he's finished winding up one, the enemy would have moved out of range, causing DT to fly closer and try to attack again, only to whiff again. This goes on and on until you either body block the enemy or it decides to randomly stop walking.

As hilarious as this is, it gets frustrating when you actually try to build around him. This mod makes it so Dt's melee has so much range he can't possibly whiff. Don't worry, he won't be killing enemies from miles away. He doesn't have that much range and even if he did, his AI is too stupid to know, so he'll still try to get into melee range regardless.
