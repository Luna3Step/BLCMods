Adds options to replace/remove all Spiderant, Varkid, Drifter and Spider spawns. 

Important Info

- Creature Slaughterhouse and The Raid on Digistruct Peak are broken. I will eventually fix them but for now that they are unusable
- The Horrible Hunger of the Ravenous Wattle Gobbler has varkids no matter what
- Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax has varkids no matter what
- Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary has most spiderants removed except for the digital ones and the Dark Web boss.
- A few quests and bosses were reworked to make this mod work. The workarounds I used are lazy and jank but I wanted something working first. I'll eventually come back to this mod once I have the will to slog my way through it.
- I am open to requests for replacing/removing other enemies if they trigger any phobias, DM me on discord (threestepauthentication) and let me know what you need.
