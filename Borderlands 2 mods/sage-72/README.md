Welcome to sage-72's mods

1.)Multi-Elemental Effervescent Pimpernel

ABOUT THE MOD:

Heavily Inspired by Aaron0000's Chroma

Makes the 5 pellets of Pimpernel be a different element each

Turned Rarity to Effervescent

Changed Texture to be Effervescent

Added E-Tech Barrel with Flaps

Changed Name to Prism-nel

Changed Red Text


PREREQUISITES: Command Extension SDK Mod and Sanity Saver SDK Mod (to disable sanity check)

If you dont know what an SDK Mod is, install "Willow2 SDK" first https://bl-sdk.github.io/willow2-mod-db/

AFTER INSTALLING:

When you're using modpacks or other mods, be sure to load this last in the console or put it at the bottom of your modpack using BLCMM so it overwrites changes made by the Modpack

You can farm for the Pimpernel or Copy paste this code to add it in-game using SDK Mod "Vendor Edit" 

BL2(hwAAAADxtwGDqIEDEaHVXoJhAPOB8AXMBBguMGBg/v/XINwDA4Lw)

If your Pimpernel has an element, I suggest re-farming or using Vendor Edit to change it back to "No Element" because this weapon already has all the elements and you're losing 20% damage for nothing.



SPECIAL THANKS
Aaron0000 for giving me permission to use his Chroma code as a base/template for making the code for the Bullets as well as letting me use his code to change the barrel to be E-Tech with the flaps

EdamaneTv ZetaDaemon and PawnM0v3 for helping me understand how to code all of this in the first place.

apple1417 for the Command Extension mod to make this happen as well as their documentation to help me make sdk mods in text
